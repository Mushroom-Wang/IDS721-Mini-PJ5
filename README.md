# Command-Line Password Manager
This is a command-line tool that can generate and store passwords for users. The tool could allow users to store their passwords in an encrypted file, retrieve passwords, and generate secure passwords using a variety of algorithms.

This code uses the `rand` crate to generate random passwords, the `rpassword` crate to read passwords from the terminal without echoing them to the screen, and the `serde_json` crate to serialize and deserialize the passwords to a file.

The main function loads the passwords from the file, parses the command-line arguments, performs the appropriate action, and saves the passwords.

## Dependencies
`rand`: This is a crate that provides a random number generator and other utilities for generating random values, such as passwords.

`rpassword`: This is a crate that provides a way to read passwords from the terminal without echoing them to the screen. This is useful for security reasons when entering passwords.

`serde` and `serde_json`: These are crates that provide a way to serialize and deserialize Rust data structures to and from JSON format. In this case, we use these crates to serialize the password data to a file in JSON format.
